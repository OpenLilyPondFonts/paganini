FONTLOG for the Paganini font
=============================

This file provides detailed information on the Paganini Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Paganini fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
Paganini is an OFL-licensed font based on the OFL-licensed Parnassus font by Kristof Bastiaensen. Since Parnassus was designed for use with Musescore (notation software), a remapping was necessary to make it compatible with LilyPond. OFL requires a name change in this instance. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
